# Algorithms and Data Structures in Apex

Welcome this repo is meant as a companion to
my [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdt84CMzTQBbon-6Oy2a_rIsOyzMTrjnn).

## Recursion

[intro to recursion](https://github.com/bdJohnson72/Algorithms_And_Data_Structures_In_Apex/tree/master/force-app/main/default/classes/recursion)

- [Watch it on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xpg0NnS90w&list=PLdt84CMzTQBbon-6Oy2a_rIsOyzMTrjnn&index=2)
- I provided some code challenges for writing recursive code. The answers are in the repo. But try to solve these first.
  1. Get the sum or a range of numbers.
  2. Compute a number to a certain power.
  3. Determine if a word is a palindrome
  4. Compute a number in the fibonacci sequence
  5. Reverse a string

## Search

    -[Linear Search]()
        -just fine for a small data set. Runs at o(N).
    -[Binary Search]()
        -The algo that made me feel like a genious the first time I saw it and understood it. It needs a sorted list to work but runs at o(Log N).

## Sorting

- [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/bdJohnson72/Algorithms_And_Data_Structures_In_Apex/tree/master/force-app/main/default/classes)
  - [Watch it on Youtube](https://youtu.be/KJVDLgfzCL8) -[Selection Sort]()
    - Like Bubble Sort but puts the smallest value into sorted position instead of the largest
